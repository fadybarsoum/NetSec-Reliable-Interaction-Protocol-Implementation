Hello~

The RIP Protocol can be found under src.rip.RIPProtocol
Yes I realize now that in a playground directory that would be src.src but hopefully that doesn't cause any issues.

Important Notes:
- Currently the closing is not implemented.
- If you want to turn on debug messages (they'll be green and start with "[RIP]" to make it easy to see), in the RIPProtocol Class, in __init__, change s.debug to True

I think that's actually basically it.
